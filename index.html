            <p class="description">
              I believe learning from the users is one of the most important
              aspects of UX. I am proficient in user interviews, usability
              testing, and understanding user behavior,wants, and needs through
              observation and task analysis. I typically need a smartphone,
              laptop, pencil and paper, and Zoom to get these done.

            <h3>USER EMPATHY</h3>
            <p>
              I want users to have the best UX possible, that can be done by
              really empathizing with them.I am proficient at creating personas,
              empathy maps, journey maps, userscenarios, and storyboards which
              helps me design around my users. After I have conducted many
              interviews, I typically use Miro, Figma, and Google Spreadsheets
              to visualize my user empathy.

            <h3>USER DESIGN</h3>
            <p>
              After having gathered enough data to pinpoint my users. I can
              design interfaces based on my users pains and gains. I typically
              use paper and pencil, Figma, and Miro to create low and high
              fidelity wireframes as well as user flows. I also have an
              understanding of HTML/CSS so I design with knowledge of the
              current capabilities and limitations of code.
